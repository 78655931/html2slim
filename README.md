## HTML2SLIM

Pre-alpha script for converting HTML (or sHTML) files to slim (slim-lang.org).

It's not perfect, but certainly it helps a lot!

It's based on Hpricot. Yeah, I'm old school.

## USAGE

  ./html2slim file.html file.slim

## OFFICIAL REPO

https://github.com/slim-template/html2slim

## ROADMAP

1. Add a decent interface!
2. ERB support, I guess
